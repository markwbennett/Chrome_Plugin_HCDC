# URGENT: Force Chrome Extension Reload

**Chrome is STILL running the old cached version despite updates!**

## NUCLEAR OPTION - Complete Extension Removal and Reinstall:

### Step 1: Complete Removal
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Harris County District Clerk Auto Clicker"
3. Click **REMOVE** (trash can icon)
4. Confirm removal

### Step 2: Clear Chrome Cache (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData`
2. Select "Advanced" tab
3. Time range: "All time"
4. Check only "Cached images and files"
5. Click "Clear data"

### Step 3: Restart Chrome Completely
1. Close ALL Chrome windows
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Restart Chrome

### Step 4: Reinstall Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `Chrome_Plugin_HCDC` folder
5. **VERIFY** it shows version 1.4

### Step 5: Test
1. Go to Harris County District Clerk case details page
2. Look for: **"HCDC Auto Clicker Ready v1.4"** indicator
3. Open console (F12)
4. Look for:
   ```
   ðŸš€ =================================
   ðŸš€ Harris County District Clerk Auto Clicker v1.4 content script loaded
   ðŸš€ CONCURRENT PROCESSING VERSION
   ðŸš€ =================================
   ```

## Alternative: Hard Refresh Method
If removal doesn't work:
1. Keep extension installed
2. Go to case details page
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) for hard refresh
4. Open console immediately
5. Look for v1.4 rocket emoji messages

## What You Should See After Proper Reload:
- "Processing all document links **concurrently**..."
- "DEBUG: Setting up 22 timeouts for concurrent processing"
- "DEBUG: Scheduling link X/22 to process in Yms"
- NO "Processing link with callback" messages
- NO "PDF processing timeout reached" messages

**If you still see the old messages, Chrome has a serious caching issue and needs the nuclear option above.**
